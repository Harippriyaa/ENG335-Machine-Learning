# ENG335-Machine-Learning

ENG335 Machine Learning introduces machine learning, covering both supervised and unsupervised algorithms. Bias-variance trade-off is discussed for selecting the appropriate models. Neural networks and convolutional neural networks are introduced. Students have the opportunity to deploy the algorithms and fine-tune the parameters. Students are required to develop and deploy a machine learning algorithm to solve a real-world challenge.
